# BID-IT PROJECT

Building an IT bid application API that gives a list of projects that are on offer/bid within a certain time frame.
Once it expires, the project can either be put back to the market or removed from the market

This is just a backend API that covers the functionality of the application from the server side with an implementation of a postgres database setup on heroku.

# How to run the API

npm run dev
